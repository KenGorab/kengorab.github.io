# kengorab.github.io
My personal site, including blog posts/articles

Changes shouldn't ever really be committed to this repo directly; the intention is for this to be a submodule of the
[personal-site](https://github.com/kengorab/personal-site) source repository, which contains all of the original, pre-compiled
markdown files from which `hugo` generates the static html pages in this repo.

Upon making changes in that repo, the built static pages will get pushed to this repo, and therefore "deployed" to my site.
